# WellIndexBenchmark
This is the documentation for WellIndexBenchmarks.

it benchmarks well indices computed with FieldOpt's WellIndexCalculator to those 
computed using Roxar's RMS for a selected set of well trajectories.


An eclipse generated output will be needed for RMS to
be able to read in the data and compute well indices.
This file will be read by both RMS and WellIndexCalculator.
The path is set inside the main.cpp and also in the RMS workflow.




Wells need to be specified in wells
